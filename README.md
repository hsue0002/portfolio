# Emily Hsueh Portfolio

## How it was created

The first thing I did to created this website, aside from creating a repository, was to include all the html and bootstrap elements. 

Next, I used derivv.com to resize all the images that I used and put them in an image folder.

I then went to getbootstrap.com to source the bootstrap elements on my site.

After styling the bootstrap elements, I moved to the css to finish the styles, using css reset and media queries.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced in developing this site was my styles not applying to my elements. To overcome this, I frequently used the element selector in my web browser to isolate the problem and revisited my code to change it. I also had trouble aligining some elements, and ended up using big margins and padding to fix it, though I don't believe that is the best way to do it. However, it was the best solution I had at the time.

## What I learned

I learned that the most dominant stylesheet should be added last. I also learned how to implement bootstrap and how easy it is.
